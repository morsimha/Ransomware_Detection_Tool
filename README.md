# Detect Infected Files
 
 Ransomware Detection Tool that was made during a one-day hackathon me and my student friends participated in.
 The tool that was developed, written and presented as part of Toga Networks hackathon.
 
The tool runs on a computer that has undergone a ransomware attack and  identify the files that were attacked / encrypted.
Finally, the tool will create a file containing all the infected files, their path and the snapshot in which they were first infected.
